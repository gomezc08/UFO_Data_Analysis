# UFO_Data_Analysis
### We webscraped our data from the National UFO Reporting Center: https://nuforc.org/
Chris' Questions:
1. Is there a correlation between UFO shape and the time of day of the sighting?
2. Does there exists any sort of relationship between time and UFO sightings?
- Above and Beyond: further showcased these correlations using classification with sklearn. I used a few classifiers to discover whether there is any relationship between the location of the sight, the shape of the UFO, the season it occured with the time of day of the report (morning, afternoon, evening, night). 

Colby's Questions:
1. What is the distribution of sightings across the states and how does it compare to their populations? 
2. Is there any correlation between spikes in dates of sightings and events?
- Above and Beyond: Used two new libraries for plotting (plotly and joyplot). I tried to learn lots about both of these libraries and wanted to create very effective, appealing plots.

## Colby's work: ufo_colby_1, ufo_colby_2
## Chris' work:  ufo_chris_1, ufo_classification
## We had a joint effort on ufo_webscrape since there was a lot of data (over 130,000 records).
