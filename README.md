# UFO_Data_Analysis
### We webscraped our data from the National UFO Reporting Center: https://nuforc.org/
Chris' Questions:
1. Is there a correlation between UFO shape and the time of day of the sighting?
2. Does there exists any sort of relationship between time and UFO sightings?
- Above and Beyond: further showcased these correlations using classification with sklearn. I used a few classifiers to discover whether there is any relationship between the location of the sight, the shape of the UFO, the season it occured with the time of day of the report (morning, afternoon, evening, night). 

Colby's Questions:
1. Patterns in sightings based on state
2. List of different states in region; group sightings together (maybe look at differ types of ufo shapes).

### Colby's work: ufo_colby_1, ufo_colby_2
### Chris' work:  ufo_chris_1, ufo_classification
### We had a joint effort on ufo_webscrape since there was a lot of data (over 130,000 records).
